# Machine Learning With Regresssion : Credit Amount and Breast Cancer Prediction 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f3e59ae-fc4f-450f-9339-7a428d7d6918)

This week we discovery machine learning through linear and logistic regression. 
For this the professor let us choose two projects. So with my colleagues Yassine Ramy and Hoda Dades, we take this two subjects : 

## What influence the borrowed credit amounts ?

We work on a data base about german credit that we found on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/code/heidarmirhajisadati/credit-risk-prediction-using-german-credit-data

Why German Credit ?

- Lower household debt ratio than other European countries
- Powerful economy and prudent financial culture
- Country where savings are valued
- Can serve as a model of economic resilience.


## Classify Breast Cancer between Benign and Malignant Tumor

We are using machine learning to classify breast tumors as either malignant or benign. 

As we know human body is made of cells and tissus ansld organs and all of this kind of things and sometimes what happens is some cells of the body may devide repeatedly without control so in this case it forms an abnormal cell called

Here tumors can not move to the other parts of the body , but here yes can move to the other parts of the body like bones, brain etc …it’s called the cancerous tumors

In our dataset, we have 569 samples. Each sample includes measurements that describe characteristics of cell nuclei from breast biopsies, like radius, texture, and perimeter. The target we want to predict is whether each tumor is ‘M’ for malignant or ‘B’ for benign. These measurements give the model information to learn from and help it make accurate predictions
